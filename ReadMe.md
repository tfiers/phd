## Neuron model

Model and parameters are from Humphries 2006, "Understanding and using
Izhikevich's simple model neuron".


## Technical details

A list of external packages this code depends on -- including their project URL's and a
description of what they are used for -- can be found in `requirements.txt`. These
packages can be installed using
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I sometimes add type hints to code (Python is an optionally typed language).  
These look like eg `t: unyt_array = ...`.  
I do this to get code completions in my IDE (namely PyCharm) when
the IDE cannot infer the type of a variable automatically.
