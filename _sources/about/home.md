# Voltage-to-wiring, the simulation

The topic of this website is that of my PhD research:

> In vivo connectomics: mapping the wires between neurons based on voltage imaging recordings.

We are currently exploring this idea using numerical simulations.

This website serves as an archive for my experiments, and a
hub for discussing them with my supervisors.


## Neuron model

Model and parameters are from Humphries 2006, _"Understanding and using Izhikevich's simple model neuron"_.
