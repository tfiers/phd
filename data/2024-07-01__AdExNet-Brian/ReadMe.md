These two files were generated by the notebook rendered at
https://tfiers.github.io/phd/nb/2024-07-01__AdExNet-Brian.html

Both are saved using NumPy, but can also be read in e.g. MATLAB or R.


### Connectivity

`connectivity_matrix.npy` contains a matrix of integers, representing the ground truth neural connectivity.

The element at `[i, j]` will be:
 - `0` if there's no connection
 - `+1` if there's an excitatory connection
 - `-4` if there's an inhibitory connection
 
 .. _from_ neuron `i` _to_ neuron `j`.


### Activity

`spiketimes.npz` contains a dictionary of spike times (floating point numbers), with units of seconds since start of the simulation.

The dictionary is indexed using keys `"neuron_0"`, `"neuron_1"`, etc.


### Loading

Both files can be opened in Python using `np.load`.

See [the documentation][docs] for more (especially on how to work with `.npz` files).
