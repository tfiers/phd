module CreateNamedTupleMacro

export @NT, @out

"""
    @NT begin â€¦ end

Creates a `NamedTuple` containing the variables defined in the given
block.

With this macro, functions that output a large namedtuple (with values
that depend on each other) become more maintainable and a tad
shorter/DRYer.

Concretely,

    f(x) = @NT begin
        a = x + 3
        b = a * x
    end

is rewritten as

    f(x) = begin
        a = x + 3
        b = a * x
        (; a, b)
    end

This is similar to using `NamedTuple(Base.@locals)` (with a `let`
block), but that breaks type inference; this macro does not.

If you want to use only a select number of variables for the namedtuple,
mark their assignment statements with `@out`:

    @NT begin
        @out a = x + 3
        b = a * x
        @out c = a + b
    end
