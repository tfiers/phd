# More specifically, run this script to instantiate the Julia projects in this repository
# (i.e. for each, create a `Manifest.toml` with all its dependencies, and install those),
# with the specification that, for inter-dependencies _within_ this project, the
# local/development versions of the packages present in this repo must be used
# (`Pkg.develop`).
