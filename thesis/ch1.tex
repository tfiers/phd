        {The causal link between neural connectivity and activity}
        {On the left, a cartoon of a synaptic connection. The axon of presynaptic neuron $M$ (in blue) impinges on postsynaptic neuron $N$ (in brown). The electrode icons indicate that their membrane voltages are recorded (shown on the right).
        A succesful spike in neuron $M$ will elicit a small but precisely-timed voltage bump in neuron $N$ (the postsynaptic potential, PSP).
        There is thus a causal relationship between 1) the existence of a connection $M$~→~$N$ and 2) both neurons' membrane voltages. This causal relationship (black arrow) is exploited to perform network inference from voltage recordings (green arrow).\newline
