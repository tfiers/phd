% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Network connectivity, E/I balance, raster plots
%     \item Too many possible connections to test them all â†’ Subsampling
%     \item Performance of last chapter's methods
%     \item If time: experiment with a network that is less densely connected than our current fully-random one. Why? To better examine the effect of indirect connections / colliders (For the current connectivity, there are too many of those. But in a more realistic, 'localized' network, there are less, and so it seems easier to isolate and examine their effect).
