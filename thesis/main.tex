\chapter{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem statement
    \item Opportunity of voltage imaging, core idea of inverting the causal `presynaptic spike → postsynaptic PSP' relation
    \item Overview of thesis
\end{itemize}


\section{Connectomics}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Motivation
    \item Ground-truth connectomics: tracing of electron microscopy and fluoresent injection imaging
    \item Necessity of connection \emph{inference}
    \item Mention `invasive' connection testing (stimulate one cell, record possible neighbours)
    \item Limitations of `connectomics', and of inferred vs `actual' connectomics.\\
        Terminology, e.g. `functional connectomics'
\end{itemize}


\section{Voltage imaging}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Technologies (from dyes to GEVIs)
    \item Specs: cell yield, tissue depth, recording duration, SNR, species
    \item ..and growth of these over time, and comparison with calcium imaging.\\
        To extrapolate how these might advance in the future
    \item Comparison with other recording techniques: ephys, calcium imaging, (and briefly mention coarser methods)
\end{itemize}


\section{Network inference}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Working with events/spikes only, versus working with continuous signals; or a hybrid as here.
    \item Overview of the spikes-only methods
    \item The connectomics competition, and the findings about the best methods
    \item Mention other application domains, like gene regulatory networks
    \item 'Spike-triggered voltage regression' of Zhou/Cai
\end{itemize}



% \chapter{Connection tests \&\\ the N-to-1 experiment}

\chapter{Simulation details}

In this chapter, we decribe our experimental setup: the neuron model we simulate, its inputs, and how we simulate voltage imaging.

\input{ch2.tex}

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item AdEx neuron, synapse model, exc and inh inputs
%     \item Poisson spike generation
%     \item Lognormal distribution of input firing rates
%     \item Influence of N \& input strength, on output firing rate \& average voltage level
%     % \item Evaluation plots
% \end{itemize}


\chapter{Spike-triggered averaging}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Principle, example STAs
    \item Influence on STA of E/I balance, output firing rate, reversal potentials
    \item Use as connection test: shuffled spike trains and height of STA, p-values, and the `area-over-start' heuristic for E vs I classification.
    \item Evaluation of a connection test: `ternary' classification, summary measures, AUROC
    \item Performance of the simple STA-height test, for different N
    \item Influence of window length
\end{itemize}


\chapter{New connection inference methods}

\section{STA Template correlation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Idea for the two-pass test
    \item Template examples. Both ideal and template found with first-pass (STA height-only)
    \item Peformance for different N, \& comparison with previous method
\end{itemize}


\section{Linear regression of the upstroke}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Non-STA method: concatenated individual windows as (X, y)
    \item Examples of pooled windows, and fits
    \item Mention the problem of unknown transmission delays
    \item Perfomance for different N, \& comparison with previous methods
\end{itemize}


\section{Fitting a full STA model}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Model design
    \item Iterative model fitting
    \item Problem of overfitting, and parameter-constraints to solve it
    \item An advantage: fit parameters (like transmission delay and time constants) are biologically ~meaningful
    \item Perfomance for different N, \& comparison with previous methods
\end{itemize}



\section{Clustering, \& Hierarchical model fitting}

\begin{itemize}
    \item (Time-permitting)
\end{itemize}


\section{Zhou/Cai's `Spike-triggered regression'}

\begin{itemize}
    \item (Time-permitting)
\end{itemize}


\section{Computational cost}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Timings of each method, extrapolation for larger number of tested connections
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Conclusions of the N-to-1 experiment
    \item Leadup to the network experiments: what we could not yet test (the problem of indirect connections, as e.g. identified in the connectomics challenge)
\end{itemize}



\chapter{Network model}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Network connectivity, E/I balance, raster plots
    \item Too many possible connections to test them all → Subsampling
    \item Performance of last chapter's methods
    \item If time: experiment with a network that is less densely connected than our current fully-random one. Why? To better examine the effect of indirect connections / colliders (For the current connectivity, there are too many of those. But in a more realistic, 'localized' network, there are less, and so it seems easier to isolate and examine their effect).
\end{itemize}


\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Summary \& conclusions}

..

\section{Future work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Test on real data
    \item Direct comparison with spikes-only methods
    \item More complexity in the testing setup: different transmission delays and time constants per synapse / neuron, plus:
    \item Short term synaptic plasticity. Bursting. Oscillations.
    \item Simulate different brain areas (different cell types and connectivity patterns). Simulate the same area, but in different states (up vs down, e.g.)
    \item New connection test method to try: something deep learning-based (we have infinite training data, given our simulation)
\end{itemize}
