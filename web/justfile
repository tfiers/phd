# Need to `conda activate phd-web` first
serve:
    python build.py
    python -m http.server -d _build/html -b localhost
# (no, can't activate here, for some reason. Neither with && nor with sep command)
# (comment above is not multiline, as `just -l` only takes last line (ðŸ™„))

# You can ignore the build error (sth about a regex)
# (it disappears when clearing the nb dir (uncomment line in build.py); but then slower rebuilds).
